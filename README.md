# IBM Policy Document Automation (EPLC Project)

This repository presents one representative example of my work from the IBM Enterprise Policy Lifecycle (EPLC) practicum. 
Additional analyses and document processing pipelines were conducted as part of the broader project but are not publicly released due to confidentiality.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to **analyze and structure U.S. government policy documents** for automation in retrieval and reasoning tasks.  
I explored policy templates, acquisition forms, and regulatory datasets from the **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** to understand how narrative texts can be converted into structured, machine-readable metadata.

## Contents
- `data/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.pdf`  
  A qualitative report summarizing the accessibility, structure, and metadata potential of five HHS policy sources.
- `data/EPLC_SLA_MOU_Template.doc`  
  An example of a Service Level Agreement / Memorandum of Understanding template from the EPLC policy archive.
- `data/EPLC_SLA_MOU_Template.json`  
  A structured JSON representation of the same document showing the extracted sections and hierarchical metadata.
- `notebooks/policy_text_embedding_demo.ipynb`  
  (To be added) Example notebook demonstrating document parsing, embedding, and retrieval using Python.

## Context
This project contributes to the broader effort of **policy knowledge automation**, aiming to improve accessibility, interoperability, and reasoning capabilities in government and institutional policy datasets.
