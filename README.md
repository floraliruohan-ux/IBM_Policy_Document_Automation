# IBM Policy Document Automation (EPLC Project)

This repository showcases exploratory and preprocessing work completed as part of the **IBM Enterprise Policy Lifecycle (EPLC)**

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to **analyze and structure U.S. government policy documents** for automation in retrieval and reasoning tasks.  
I explored policy templates, acquisition forms, and regulatory datasets from the **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** to understand how narrative texts can be converted into structured, machine-readable metadata.

## 📂 Contents
- `data/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.pdf`  
  A qualitative report summarizing the accessibility, structure, and metadata potential of five HHS policy sources.
- `data/EPLC_SLA_MOU_Template.doc`  
  An example of a Service Level Agreement / Memorandum of Understanding template from the EPLC policy archive.
- `data/EPLC_SLA_MOU_Template.json`  
  A structured JSON representation of the same document showing the extracted sections and hierarchical metadata.
- `notebooks/policy_text_embedding_demo.ipynb`  
  (To be added) Example notebook demonstrating document parsing, embedding, and retrieval using Python.

## 🧰 Methods
- **Text Parsing:** Python-based extraction and cleaning of document sections.  
- **Document Structuring:** Conversion of narrative documents into JSON metadata schemas.  
- **Embedding:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual policy reasoning.  

## 🌍 Context
This project contributes to the broader effort of **policy knowledge automation**, aiming to improve accessibility, interoperability, and reasoning capabilities in government and institutional policy datasets.
